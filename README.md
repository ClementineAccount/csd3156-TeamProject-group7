# Game Pitch
The game concept to be pitched simple AR 'collection' game similar to [Pokemon Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go) but using the ['cookie clicker' concept.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker)

The player will be able to place cube objects into the game world as 'farms' and use them to gather objects that will be added to a database, similar to the photo below.

## Proposed Mobile Features
The following mobile features are proposed, using images from the reference game of Pokemon Go as examples.

### Sensors (GPS)
The GPS of the phone may be used to indicate where the collectables are in the SIT@SP campus. (Does not have to be a 3D Map)

### Camera
The Camera of the phone will be used in order to 'collect' the object by pointing the camera at the collectable, similar to in Pokemon Go

### Databases
The player's save data, such as their inventory and the collectables they have obtained, may be saved in a database.

### OpenGL ES
The graphical assets of the collectables may be drawn using OpenGL ES ontop of a camera view. Whether the assets are in 3D or 2D will be determined at a later date.

### Time and Date
The price of shapes change through the day and according to the day of the week, which uses the phone's Time and Date features.
