# Game Pitch 1
The game concept to be pitched simple AR 'collection' game similar to [Pokemon Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go). 
The player will be able to go around the SIT@SP campus in order to collect objects using their phone camera. Their goal is to obtain AR collectables that are generated on the map, which they can collect using the phone camera system.

By choosing to make a Pokemon Go style game, this allows the project's scope to be very focused to mobile features. The gameplay will be very derivative of Pokemon Go as the project serves as a tech demonstration, but will use fully original assets that we own the copyright of. By making the game in the AR collectable genre, it also serves to prevent the scope of the game from being focused on non-mobile features, such as 'gameplay feeling', player controls, game balance and so on, which would be irrelevant for this Project's goals.

## Proposed Mobile Features
The following mobile features are proposed, using images from the reference game of Pokemon Go as examples.

### Sensors (GPS)
The GPS of the phone may be used to indicate where the collectables are in the SIT@SP campus.

### Camera
The Camera of the phone will be used in order to 'collect' the object by pointing the camera at the collectable, similar to in Pokemon Go

### Databases
The player's save data, such as their inventory and the collectables they have obtained, may be saved in a database.

### OpenGL ES
The graphical assets of the collectables may be drawn using OpenGL ES ontop of a camera view. Whether the assets are in 3D or 2D will be determined at a later date.
